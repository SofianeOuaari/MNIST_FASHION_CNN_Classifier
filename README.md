# MNIST_FASHION_CNN_Classifier
In this repository I used tensorflow and keras to implement a model that uses convolutional neural networks for a supervised task with categorical data. The goal of this model  is to classify images of clothes into one of the 10 different labels. 

Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:

0 T-shirt/top
1 Trouser
2 Pullover
3 Dress
4 Coat
5 Sandal
6 Shirt
7 Sneaker
8 Bag
9 Ankle boot
